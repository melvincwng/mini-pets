# Mini Pets

Mini Pets is a digital pet game where you raise a virtual pet slime by feeding it, playing with it and cleaning it every 8 hours.

As you feed, play or clean your pet slime, it will gain levels and upon hitting certain levels/milestones, it will evolve and change color.

Have fun unlocking the various pet slimes available!

Will you be the lucky one to unlock the RARE and SPECIAL FIRE SLIME???? :D

# Troubleshooting

When re-exporting the app in future, you may encounter some issues/errors/app crashes. I have compiled a list of issues which I've encountered before when debugging in logcat (Android Studio):

1.  java.lang.RuntimeException (see local screenshot for reference):
    - If you see this error in logcat, it means you forgot to or did not configure correctly the Admob App ID on the AndroidManifest.xml.
    - This will cause your app to crash when launched.
    - Refer to links 1 & 2 below, and follow their documentation to re-setup the project AND follow their troubleshooting.
2.  java.lang.VerifyError (see local screenshot for reference):
    - If you see this error in logcat, it probably means you are using an incompatible version of the Godot Game Engine & the Godot-Android-Admob-Plugin.
    - What happened previously was that I was using the latest version of Godot Game Engine (V3.4.4) that supported API level 30 (Android 11 OS), however the Admob-Plugin (V4.1.1) which I used was only supporting API level 29 (Android 10 OS).
    - Due to this mismatch/incompatibility, it will cause crashes when the app is launched.
    - The solution is to use a version of Godot Game Engine (e.g. v3.4.4) and a version of the Admob-Plugin (e.g. V5.1.0) that are compatible (in this case, both versions support API level 30).
3.  Check if you have the latest versions/packages for Android SDK installed.
    - Outdated versions/packages could result in app crashes/issues.
    - See link 3 below for reference on where to find the latest packages to install
4.  Before exporting to HTML game, please make sure that you tick/allow hiDPI in your project settings.
    - Otherwise, the exported HTML game will be of lower/poorer resolution.
5.  References for debugging errors/issues:
    - https://developers.google.com/admob/android/quick-start (Refer to their 'Configure your app - Step 3' to see what you need to configure in the AndroidManifest.xml)
    - https://github.com/Shin-NiL/Godot-Android-Admob-Plugin (Refer to their a) Documentation on how to use the plugin && b) 'Troubleshooting' section to debug as well)
    - https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_android.html (To check if you've installed the latest Android SDK)
