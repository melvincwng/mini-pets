# Mini Pets
Mini Pets is a digital pet game where you raise a virtual pet slime by feeding it, playing with it and cleaning it every 8 hours. 

As you feed, play or clean your pet slime, it will gain levels and upon hitting certain levels/milestones, it will evolve and change color.

Have fun unlocking the various pet slimes available!

Will you be the lucky one to unlock the RARE and SPECIAL FIRE SLIME???? :D
